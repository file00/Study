# Main purpose of this repositoryie
This repository is purely for organizing and recording what I have studied.

Personally, I'm going to post basic concept-oriented, and only the core content without long codes.

The programming languages to cover are C language, Python, HTML & CSS,
In case of language C, I will write the same code in C++ version and upload it together.
